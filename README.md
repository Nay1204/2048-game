# 2048-game
This is the analysis of  2048 game implementation. The code utilizes the Tkinter library for creating the game window and visuals.
## Classes:
● Board: This class handles the game board logic, including:
   ○ Initializing the board with empty cells and setting up the visual elements.
   ○ Detecting key presses (Up, Down, Left, Right) and updating the game state.
   ○ Implementing core game mechanics:
        ■ Compressing tiles towards a specific direction (compressGrid).
        ■ Merging adjacent tiles with the same value (mergeGrid).
        ■ Placing a new random tile on an empty cell (random_cell).
        ■ Checking for possible merges on the board (can_merge).
        ■ Updating the visual representation of the board based on tile values (paintGrid).
● Game: This class manages the overall game flow:
   ○ Initializing the game window, board, and flags for win/end conditions.
   ○ Handling key presses and calling corresponding methods from Board to process moves.
   ○ Checking for win (reaching a tile with value 2048) and lose (no empty cells and no merges) conditions after each move.
   ○ Placing a new random tile if the game continues (not won or lost).
   ○ Updating the visual representation of the board and score.
## Functionality:
1. Board Initialization:
   ○ Creates a 4x4 grid to represent the game board.
   ○ Initializes a dictionary to map tile values to background colors and text colors.
   ○ Sets up the main game window, frame for the board, and individual label widgets for each tile.
2. Game Loop:
   ○ Place two initial tiles on the board.
   ○ Binds key presses (arrow keys) to the link_keys function in the Game class.
   ○ Enters the main event loop, waiting for user interaction.
3. Key Press Handling (link_keys function):
   ○ Checks for win or lose conditions before processing key presses.
   ○ Resets flags related to movement, compression, and merging.
   ○ Transposes or reverses the board as needed based on the pressed key (Up, Down).
   ○ Calls compress Grid and mergeGrid functions to move and merge tiles.
   ○ Checks if any tiles actually moved during the turn.
   ○ Checks for win and lose conditions.
   ○ Place a new random tile if the game continues.
   ○ Updates the visual representation of the board and prints the current score.

## Conclusion
Overall, the code demonstrates a well-structured approach to implementing the 2048 game in Python. It effectively utilizes object-oriented programming principles to separate game logic (Board) and overall flow management (Game). The code provides a playable game with clear win and lose conditions.
